#+TITLE: Mineswpr Visual Upgrade - Product Requirements Document
#+STARTUP: showall

* Introduction/Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for upgrading the visual design of the Mineswpr game to create a more
modern, sleek, and professional appearance. The upgrade involves adopting shadcn/ui as the component library,
implementing a dark theme with bright highlights, and enhancing the overall user interface while maintaining
the core gameplay mechanics and mobile-first approach.

The goal is to transform the current interface into a contemporary, professional-looking game that appeals to
modern users while preserving all existing functionality and usability standards.

* Goals
1. Integrate shadcn/ui component library to provide a modern, consistent design system
2. Implement a professional dark theme with bright (non-neon) accent colors
3. Increase visual contrast across all interface elements for better readability
4. Modernize all UI components including game cells, controls, and layout elements
5. Maintain existing gameplay mechanics and mobile-first responsive design
6. Establish a foundation for future animation enhancements
7. Establish a foundation for adding more themes in the future.
* User Stories
** As a casual mobile gamer, I want to:
- Experience a visually appealing, modern game interface that feels contemporary
- Clearly distinguish between different game elements with improved contrast
- Continue playing with the same familiar controls and interactions
- Enjoy a professional-looking game that doesn't feel dated or toy-like
** As a desktop user, I want to:
- See a sleek, professional interface that matches modern web application standards
- Have clear visual hierarchy and improved readability across all game elements
- Experience consistent design patterns throughout the application

* Functional Requirements
** Phase 1: Foundation and Core Components
- Component Library Integration :: The system must integrate shadcn/ui as the primary component library
- Design System Setup :: The system must establish a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing system
- Game Cell Redesign :: Game cells must be redesigned with modern styling while maintaining 44px minimum
  touch targets
- Control Panel Upgrade :: Game controls (reset button, status display) must be updated with shadcn/ui
  components
- Dark Theme Implementation :: The system must implement a professional dark
  theme as the primary interface. More themes will be added in the future.
** Phase 2: Layout and Navigation
- Header/Navigation :: The system must include a modern header with consistent branding and navigation
  elements
- Game Board Container :: The game board container must be redesigned with modern card-like styling
- Responsive Layout Enhancement :: The layout must maintain responsiveness while incorporating new design
  elements
- Typography Upgrade :: All text elements must use a modern, professional font hierarchy
** Phase 3: Advanced UI Elements
- Status Indicators :: Game status (win/lose/playing) must have clear, professional visual indicators
- Interactive Feedback :: All interactive elements must provide appropriate hover and focus states
- Loading States :: The system must include professional loading indicators where appropriate
- Error Handling UI :: Any error states must be displayed with consistent, professional styling

* Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Animations and micro-interactions (reserved for future phase)
2. Multiple theme options (focus on single professional dark theme, more will be
   added later)
3. Custom component development (use shadcn/ui components as much as possible)
4. Gameplay mechanic changes or new features
5. Performance optimization (unless directly related to visual changes)
6. Mobile app conversion or PWA enhancements beyond current scope

* Design Considerations
- Color Scheme :: Professional dark theme with bright (non-neon) accent colors for highlights and
  interactive elements
- Typography :: Clean, modern font stack with clear hierarchy and excellent readability
- Contrast :: High contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards while maintaining visual appeal
- Component Consistency :: Leverage shadcn/ui's design tokens for consistent spacing, colors, and styling
- Professional Aesthetic :: Move away from game-like styling toward modern web application appearance
- Mobile-First :: Maintain existing mobile optimization and touch-friendly design principles

* Technical Considerations
- Dependency Management :: Add shadcn/ui and its dependencies to the existing Next.js/Tailwind setup
- Theme Configuration :: Configure Tailwind CSS to work with shadcn/ui's design tokens
- Component Migration :: Systematically replace existing components with shadcn/ui equivalents
- CSS Architecture :: Maintain existing CSS structure while integrating new design system
- Build Process :: Ensure new dependencies don't significantly impact build times or bundle size
- Testing :: Update existing component tests to account for new styling and structure

* Success Metrics
- Visual Consistency :: All UI elements follow the new design system consistently
- Accessibility Compliance :: Maintain or improve WCAG contrast ratios with the new color scheme
- Performance Maintenance :: No significant degradation in load times or rendering performance
- Mobile Compatibility :: All existing mobile functionality works seamlessly with new design
- Code Quality :: Clean integration of shadcn/ui without breaking existing functionality

* Open Questions
1. Should we implement a system for future theme switching, or focus solely on
   the dark professional theme? Yes, implememt a system for future theme
   switching.
2. Are there specific shadcn/ui components we should prioritize or avoid for
   this gaming context? Use your best judgment.
3. Should we maintain any elements of the current design as transition aids for
   existing users? No need.
4. What specific bright accent colors would you prefer for highlights (e.g.,
   blue, green, purple)? Use your best judgment.
5. Should we include any subtle branding elements or keep the interface
   completely minimal? Keep it minimal for now
