#+TITLE: Safe Starting Cells for All Levels - Product Requirements Document
#+STARTUP: showall

* Introduction/Overview

The minesweeper game currently provides a guaranteed safe starting cell at
position (0,0) with visual indication and a 3x3 mine-free zone around it. This
feature should be extended to provide the same safe starting experience when
new levels are generated in endless mode. Each level should have its own safe
starting cell at the upper-left corner with identical visual styling and
interaction behavior.

The goal is to reduce player frustration and provide consistent, predictable
safe starting points throughout the endless mode experience, making level
transitions more user-friendly and maintaining the accessibility benefits of
guaranteed safe cells.

* Goals

1. Provide consistent safe starting experience across all levels in endless mode
2. Maintain visual consistency with existing safe cell indicator styling
3. Ensure all interactions with safe cells result in automatic revelation
4. Preserve existing 3x3 mine-free zone logic for each level's safe area
5. Integrate seamlessly with current level generation and boundary mechanics

* User Stories
- As a player progressing through endless mode, I want to see a visually
  distinct safe starting cell at the beginning of each new level, so that I
  know where I can safely begin exploring without risk.
- As a player who has completed a level, I want the next level's safe cell to
  be clearly marked and automatically reveal when I interact with it, so that
  I can continue playing without hesitation or accidental flagging.
- As a mobile player using touch controls, I want any touch interaction (tap or
  long-press) on a safe cell to reveal it immediately, so that I don't
  accidentally flag the guaranteed safe starting position.
- As a player familiar with the game mechanics, I want each level's safe zone
  to follow the same 3x3 mine-exclusion rules, so that the safe starting
  experience is predictable and consistent.
* Functional Requirements
1. The system must generate a safe starting cell at the upper-left corner of
   every level (not just level 1).
2. The system must exclude mines from a 3x3 area around each level's safe
   starting cell, following the same logic as the initial (0,0) position.
3. The system must apply the same visual styling to safe starting cells in all
   levels as currently used for the initial safe cell.
4. The system must automatically reveal safe starting cells when clicked,
   tapped, right-clicked, or long-pressed (any interaction should result in
   revelation).
5. The system must prevent flagging of safe starting cells - all interaction
   modes should bypass flagging logic and directly reveal the cell.
6. The system must maintain safe cell indicators until the cell is revealed by
   player interaction.
7. The system must integrate with existing level boundary mechanics without
   affecting reveal propagation rules between levels.
8. The system must ensure safe starting cells are positioned at the first row
   of each level (relative to level boundaries, not absolute board position).

* Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Automatic scrolling to new safe cells when levels become accessible
- Notifications or animations highlighting new safe cells
- Alternative safe cell positions (always upper-left corner)
- Different visual styling for safe cells in different levels
- Safe cell indicators in classic/finite game modes
- Multiple safe cells per level

* Design Considerations
The feature should reuse existing visual components and styling for safe cell
indicators. The current safe cell styling includes distinct visual markers that
differentiate it from regular unrevealed cells. This same styling should be
applied consistently across all levels.

Integration with the existing CSS Grid layout system should maintain proper
cell positioning and responsive behavior. The visual indicator should work
seamlessly with the current dark theme and mobile touch targets.

* Technical Considerations
- Must integrate with existing mine generation logic in =endlessConfig.ts= and
  =gameLogic.ts=
- Should leverage current safe cell detection and styling mechanisms
- Must work with level boundary detection and level transition components
- Should maintain performance standards for endless mode memory management
- Must coordinate with useGameState hook for proper state management
- Should preserve existing touch event handling for mobile optimization

* Success Metrics
- Safe starting cells are visually distinct and functionally correct in 100%
  of generated levels
- Zero instances of accidental flagging of safe starting cells
- Consistent user experience across level transitions
- No performance degradation in endless mode with multiple safe cells
- All safe cell interactions result in immediate revelation as expected

* Open Questions
- Should safe cell visual indicators have any fade-out or transition effects
  when revealed? Follow existing styling exactly.
- Are there any specific accessibility considerations for multiple safe cell
  indicators in the viewport? No
- Should the safe cell logic account for any future changes to level size
  configuration? No
