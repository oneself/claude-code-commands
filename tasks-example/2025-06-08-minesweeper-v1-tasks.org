* Notes
- Tests are placed in a dedicated =test= directory following the PRD requirements
- Use =npx jest= to run all tests or =npx jest [path/to/test/file]= for specific test files
- Components use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Custom hooks separate concerns and make components more testable
