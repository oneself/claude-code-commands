# Sample Project PRD and Tasks Example

This is a series of PRDs and task files used to create the simple web-base
minesweeper game.  The game is available at
[mineswpr.app](http://mineswpr.app/). There were created by issues the Claude
Code commands in the parent directory.

`mineswpr-overview.org` provides an overview of the project and refers to the
difference phases of work.

The rest of the files are pairs of RPD (`-prd.org`) and tasks (`-tasks.org`)
which cover the various phases of the project in order.
