* Goal
Build a modern, mobile-first Minesweeper game with contemporary design and
optimized user experience. The project delivers a fully functional,
touch-friendly web-based implementation that works seamlessly across desktop and
mobile devices with professional visual design and intelligent gameplay
enhancements.

* Technical Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component library for modern UI components
- Custom hooks for state management and responsive design
- Comprehensive test suite with Jest + React Testing Library
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile-optimized touch event handling
- Professional dark theme with WCAG AA compliance
- Responsive CSS grid implementation

* Phase 1: Core Minesweeper Implementation
- [[file:2025-06-08-minesweeper-v1-prd.org][2025-06-08-minesweeper-v1-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 40 tasks completed across 5 major areas
- Responsive grid generation - Adapts to screen size at game start
- Core game mechanics - Mine placement (15% density), adjacent counting, cascade reveals
- Touch-optimized controls - Interactive cell management with 44px+ touch targets
- Modern UI foundation - Clean design with Tailwind CSS
- Complete game flow - Win/lose detection, reset functionality

* Phase 2: Visual Upgrade with shadcn/ui Integration
- [[file:2025-06-11-visual-upgrade-prd.org][2025-06-11-visual-upgrade-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 25 tasks completed across 3 major areas

* Phase 3: Enhanced Cascading Revelation
- [[file:2025-06-13-enhanced-cascading-revelation-prd.org][2025-06-13-enhanced-cascading-revelation-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 33 tasks completed
- Swapped interaction behavior - Left-click flags, right-click reveals
- Intelligent cascading logic - Automatic reveals when mines correctly flagged
- Mobile touch optimization - Tap flags, long-press reveals
- Recursive revelation system - Efficient multi-level cascading
- Click reduction optimization - 20%+ fewer clicks required to complete games

* Phase 4: Lives System Implementation
- [[file:2025-06-14-lives-system-prd.org][2025-06-14-lives-system-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 21 tasks completed across 6 major areas
- Multiple lives system - Start with 3 lives, lose one per mistake instead of immediate game over
- Error visual feedback - Red explosion for revealed mines, red X for incorrect flags
- Lives counter display - Header integration with heart icon and number
- Game over overlay - Clear end state with restart option when all lives lost
- Accessibility improvements - Makes game more approachable for new players

* Phase 5: Endless Mode Implementation
- [[file:2025-06-15-endless-mode-prd.org][2025-06-15-endless-mode-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 52 tasks completed across 6 major areas
- Infinite board generation - Dynamic row creation with intelligent memory management
- Progressive difficulty scaling - Mine density increases from 10% to 25% every 50 rows
- Automatic viewport scrolling - Smooth scrolling based on player progress
- Score system integration - Points awarded for correctly revealed mines
- Performance optimization - Efficient row cleanup and memory usage management

* Phase 6: Level Transitions and Progression System
- [[file:2025-06-21-level-transitions-prd.org][2025-06-21-level-transitions-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 33 tasks completed across 6 major areas
- Visual level transitions - Subtle boundary lines every 30 rows (optimized for faster testing)
- Level indicator in header - Shows current level next to lives and score counters
- Level boundary mechanics - Cell reveals stop at level edges, requiring completion before progression  
- Level completion detection - Real-time tracking of completed levels and accessibility rules
- Progressive level access - Players must complete levels sequentially to unlock new ones
- Comprehensive test coverage - 47 new tests covering all level transition functionality

* Recent Enhancements (Latest Updates)
- Level size optimization - Reduced from 50 to 30 rows per level for quicker manual testing
- UI refinements - Moved level indicator from game board to header menu with "L" icon
- Visual improvements - Added subtle white boundary lines between levels with hover isolation
- Adjacent mine counting fix - Corrected mine calculations across level boundaries for accurate gameplay
- Color consistency - Updated flag icon in header to match orange color of flagged cells

* Phase 7: Safe Starting Cells for All Levels
- [[file:2025-06-28-safe-starting-cells-prd.org][2025-06-28-safe-starting-cells-prd.org]]
- Status: ✅ 100% Complete - All 24 tasks completed across 5 major areas
- Multi-level safe zones - Extended safe starting cell logic from just (0,0) to all level starting positions
- Enhanced mine generation - Updated mine placement algorithms to exclude 3x3 safe zones around each level's starting cell
- Universal safe cell detection - Extended =isSafeStartingCell= function to work across all levels in endless mode
- Consistent interaction behavior - Safe cells auto-reveal on any interaction (tap, click, right-click, long-press) 
- Comprehensive testing - Complete test coverage for safe cell detection, mine exclusion, styling, and interaction behavior
