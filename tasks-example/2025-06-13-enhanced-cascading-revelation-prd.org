#+TITLE: Enhanced Cascading Revelation - Product Requirements Document
#+STARTUP: showall

* Introduction/Overview
This PRD outlines improvements to the Mineswpr game's cascading revelation
functionality to reduce the number of clicks required, to make gameplay more
efficient, and improve game flow. The enhancement involves swapping the
left/right click behavior and implementing aggressive cascading revelation that
triggers when mines are correctly flagged.

The goal is to streamline the user experience by making flagging the primary
action (left-click) and implementing intelligent auto-revelation when the game
logic can safely determine additional cells should be revealed.

* Goals
1. Reduce the total number of clicks required to complete a Minesweeper game
2. Make mine flagging the primary interaction by swapping left/right click behavior
3. Implement aggressive cascading revelation that triggers on correct mine flags
4. Maintain game safety by preventing accidental mine reveals
5. Preserve existing win/lose conditions and game balance
6. Ensure mobile touch interactions follow the same behavioral changes

* User Stories
** As a Minesweeper player, I want to:
- Flag potential mines with a simple left-click or tap so I can quickly mark
  dangerous cells
- Have the game automatically reveal safe cells when I've correctly flagged all
  adjacent mines
- Experience faster gameplay with fewer required clicks to complete a game
- Trust that the game won't accidentally reveal mines during auto-cascade
  sequences
** As a mobile player, I want to:
- Flag mines with a simple tap and reveal cells with long-press for consistent
  behavior
- Benefit from the same cascading improvements on touch devices

* Functional Requirements
** Core Interaction Changes
- Left-Click Flagging :: Left-click (or single tap on mobile) must
  flag/unflag a cell instead of revealing it
- Right-Click Revealing :: Right-click (or long-press on mobile) must reveal
  a cell instead of flagging it
- Mobile Touch Consistency :: Mobile interactions must follow the same
  behavioral swap as desktop
** Enhanced Cascading Logic
- Flag-Triggered Cascading :: When a mine is correctly flagged, the system
  must immediately check all adjacent numbered cells to see if they now have
  all their mines flagged
- Numbered Cell Auto-Reveal :: If a numbered cell has all its adjacent mines
  correctly flagged, the system must automatically reveal it.
- Recursive Cascading :: Auto-revealed cells must trigger further cascading
  checks, continuing until no more cells can be safely revealed
- Mine Safety Protection :: The cascading system must never automatically
  reveal or flag a cell containing a mine
- Incorrect Flag Prevention :: Cascading must not trigger if any adjacent
  flagged cells are not actually mines
** Game State Preservation
- Win Condition Maintenance :: Existing win condition logic (all non-mine
  cells revealed) must remain unchanged
- Lose Condition Maintenance :: Existing lose condition logic (mine cell
  revealed) must remain unchanged
- Game Reset Behavior :: All new behaviors must work correctly with the
  existing game reset functionality

* Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. User interface changes or visual feedback for the new control scheme
2. Settings or options to toggle between old and new behavior
3. Onboarding or tutorial elements explaining the new controls
4. Changes to mine density, grid sizing, or other game balance parameters
5. Performance optimizations beyond what's required for the new cascading logic
6. Changes to win/lose condition calculations or scoring mechanisms

* Design Considerations
- Behavioral Consistency :: All platforms (desktop, mobile) must use the same
  interaction paradigm
- Safety First :: The cascading logic must be conservative and never risk
  revealing mines
- Performance :: Recursive cascading must be efficient and not cause
  noticeable delays
- State Integrity :: Game state must remain consistent throughout cascading
  operations

* Technical Considerations
- Event Handler Updates :: Left/right click and touch event handlers need to
  be swapped in Cell component
- Cascading Algorithm :: New algorithm must efficiently check numbered cells
  and trigger recursive reveals
- Mine Detection :: Logic must accurately identify when flagged cells are
  actual mines vs. incorrect flags
- State Management :: useGameState hook needs updates to handle new cascading
  triggers
- Testing :: Comprehensive tests required for new interaction patterns and
  cascading edge cases
- Cross-Browser :: New right-click behavior must work consistently across
  browsers and devices

* Success Metrics
- Click Reduction :: Average clicks to complete a game should decrease by at
  least 20%
- Functionality :: 100% of cascading scenarios work correctly without
  revealing mines
- Cross-Platform :: New interactions work consistently on desktop and mobile
  devices
- Safety :: Zero instances of accidental mine reveals during automated
  cascading
- Performance :: Cascading operations complete within 50ms for typical grid
  sizes

* Open Questions
1. Should there be any visual indication when cascading is occurring, or should
   it be instant? It should be instant for now, but we will add a visual
   indication in the future.
2. How should the system handle rapid successive flagging that could trigger
   multiple cascades? The system should prevent flagging until each cascade is
   complete.
3. Should cascading be limited to a maximum depth to prevent potential infinite
   loops? No.
4. Are there any specific browser compatibility concerns with the right-click
   behavior changes? No.
5. Should the system provide any feedback when incorrect flags prevent cascading
   from occurring? No.
