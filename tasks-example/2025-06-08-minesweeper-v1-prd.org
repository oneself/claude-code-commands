#+TITLE: Minesweeper Game Called "Mineswpr" - Product Requirements Document
#+STARTUP: showall

* Introduction/Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for building a web-based, mobile-friendly
implementation of the classic Minesweeper puzzle game. The goal is to create an
entertaining, nostalgic gaming experience that works seamlessly across desktop
and mobile devices, targeting casual mobile gamers.

The game will provide a modern take on the traditional Minesweeper experience
with a clean, contemporary visual design while maintaining the core gameplay
mechanics that made the original popular.

* Goals
1. Create a fully functional web-based Minesweeper game that works on both
   desktop and mobile devices
2. Deliver an intuitive, touch-friendly user interface optimized for mobile gameplay
3. Implement responsive design that adapts grid size based on screen dimensions
4. Provide instant playability without complex setup or registration
   requirements
5. Maintain high performance and fast loading times across all target devices

* User Stories
** As a casual mobile gamer, I want to:
- Quickly start a game of Minesweeper during short breaks
- Play comfortably on my phone with touch-friendly controls
- Have the game adapt to my screen size automatically, but only on game start.

* Functional Requirements
1. Game Grid Generation :: The system must generate a rectangular grid with
   mines randomly distributed
2. Responsive Grid Sizing :: The grid size must automatically adjust based on
   the user's screen dimensions, but only on game start.
3. Cell Revelation :: Users must be able to reveal cells by left-clicking
   (desktop) or tapping (mobile)
4. Mine Flagging :: Users must be able to flag potential mines by
   right-clicking (desktop) or long-pressing (mobile)
5. Number Display :: Revealed cells must display the count of adjacent mines
   (1-8) or remain empty if zero
6. Cascade Revelation :: When a cell with zero adjacent mines is revealed, all
   connected empty cells must be automatically revealed. Also, when a mine is
   correctly flagged, all connected revealed cells that have revealed mines
   matching the number displayed in them, should automatically revealed
   recursively.
7. Game State Detection :: The system must detect and display win conditions
   (all non-mine cells revealed)
8. Game State Detection :: The system must detect and display lose conditions
   (mine cell revealed)
9. Game Reset :: Users must be able to start a new game via a reset button
10. Mine Density :: The system must maintain appropriate mine density relative
    to grid size for balanced gameplay
11. Visual Feedback :: The system must provide clear visual distinction
    between revealed cells, flagged cells, and unrevealed cells
12. Touch Optimization :: All interactions must be optimized for touch input
    with appropriate touch target sizes

* Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Timer functionality or time-based scoring
2. Difficulty level selection or custom grid configuration
3. Score tracking or leaderboards
4. Hint system or gameplay assistance
5. User accounts or authentication
6. Social features or sharing capabilities
7. Sound effects or audio feedback
8. Game state persistence between browser sessions
9. Multiplayer functionality
10. Offline/PWA capabilities in the first version
* Design Considerations

- Modern Aesthetic :: Clean, contemporary visual design that moves away from
  retro Windows-era styling
- Mobile-First Approach :: Touch targets must be at least 44px in size for
  comfortable mobile interaction
- Color Scheme :: Use modern color palette with good contrast ratios for
  accessibility
- Typography :: Clear, readable fonts that work well at small sizes on mobile
  devices
- Responsive Layout :: Single-column layout that centers the game grid and
  controls
- Loading States :: Minimal loading time with instant game initialization
- Visual Hierarchy :: Clear distinction between game area and control elements

* Technical Considerations
- Frontend Stack :: TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend :: Python with Supabase (if backend and database functionality
  needed in future iterations)
- Deployment :: Vercel for hosting and deployment
- Testing :: Tests should be placed into a =test= directory. Test coverage
  should be maintained.
- Build :: Use =asdf install= to install node, if needed. Use =asdf local= to adjust
  version of needed.
- Performance :: Client-side game logic for instant responsiveness
- Browser Compatibility :: Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile Optimization :: Touch event handling and responsive CSS grid implementation
- Code Organization :: Modular component structure for maintainability and
  future feature additions
- Makefile :: Create a Makefile with all relevant make, build, test, deploy commands.

* Success Metrics
- Functionality :: 100% of core game mechanics working correctly across
  target devices
- Responsiveness :: Game loads and responds to user input within 100ms
- Mobile Usability :: Successful completion of game sessions on mobile
  devices without UI issues
- Cross-Device Compatibility :: Consistent gameplay experience across desktop
  and mobile platforms
- User Engagement :: Users can complete full game sessions without technical
  interruptions

* Open Questions
1. What should be the exact mine density ratio for optimal difficulty balance? 15%
2. Should there be any visual animations for cell reveals or game state changes?
   No
3. What specific breakpoints should be used for different screen size
   adaptations? Not sure, use your best judgment.
4. Should the game prevent accidental moves (e.g., confirmation for potentially
   game-ending moves)? No
5. What should be the minimum and maximum grid sizes for different device
   categories? 8x8 minimum size.
