# Commit Code to GitHub

Commit code to GitHub with a descriptive message.

## Process
- **Review Changes**: Review all the changes created since last commit.
- **Add Files**: Add all edited files to git index.
- **Commit Changes**: Commit changes with an informative commit message.

## Commit Message
- Start with a high level description of the change.
- Only list important files and what changed in each.

## Output Format
The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```
[One line description of the change.]

- [file1]: [Description of changes in file1]
- [file2]: [Description of changes in file2]
...
```

## Content Notes
- Focus on the most significant changes. Not every file or modification needs to
  be mentioned, only those that are crucial to understanding the overall change.
- The message should be clear for someone who is not technical to understand the
  changes made.
